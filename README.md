Notes:
------

I have used Cucumber to make BDD, but it was my first time.. 
So please be patient if you see not too good code in the test..


Capistrano instructions:
------------------------

This app already includes the Capfile and deploy.rb files needed for deploy.
Please check this files, since there are some placeholders such the deploy directory, the :web, :app, :db roles, etc..
To make it work in a real production server, you must to provide real values for this placeholders, 
and take care to run gems related tasks (such Sunspot or Whenever) to run succesfully the app.
